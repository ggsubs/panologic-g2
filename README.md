# Pano Logic Zero Client G2 

## Introduction

This project contains the reverse engineering results of the Pano Logic Zero Client G2.

It was started by [cyrozap](https://github.com/cyrozap/Pano-Logic-Zero-Client-G2-FPGA-Demo), who
did all the hard work of figuring out connections between the FPGA and peripheral ICs. Some of this work
can also be found on [his wiki page](https://pano-wiki.cyrozap.com/wiki:g2_zero_client), though 
this GitHub repo should now all have that information as well.

The Pano Logic G2 is the successor of the [Pano Logic G1](https://github.com/tomverbeure/panologic). Like the
G1, it has all the interfaces that are needed to build a small mini-computer with an FPGA.

Compared to the G1, the most important improvements of G2 are:

* Much larger FPGA: a [Xilinx Spartan-6 XC6SLX150](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds160.pdf) instead 
  of a Xilinx Spartan-3E XC3S1600E.

    This is one of the largest Spartan-6 devices, with 147k logic cells, 1.3Mbit of block RAM and 180 DSPs. A huge upgrade compared to 
    the 33k logic cells, 231kbit of block RAM and 36 multipliers of the G1 FPGA.

    Unfortunately, this FPGA is also the biggest disadvantage: *it's not supported by the free Xilinx Webpack version of ISE!*

    Since the commercial version costs many thousands of dollars, this makes this device out of reach for more, if not all, 
    hobbyists.

* 256MByte of DDR2 SDRAM instead of 32MByte of LPDDR SDRAM.

* 128Mbit serial flash instead of 8Mbit.

* DVI instead of VGA output

* Micro-HDMI output

* Gigabit Ethernet 

## Disassembly

Overly detailed disassembly pictures can be found [here](https://tomverbeure.github.io/pano/logic/2018/12/02/Pano-Logic-G2-Disassembly.html).

## JTAG

Instructions on how to get the JTAG going are [here](https://tomverbeure.github.io/pano/logic/2018/12/03/Pano-logic-JTAG-First-Contact.html).

## FPGA Connections

  See the [Pano.ucf](Pano.ucf) file for all the FPGA connections.

  There were all reverse engineered by cyrozap.

* 2x [Micron MT47H32M16NF-25E](https://www.micron.com/parts/dram/ddr2-sdram/mt47h32m16nf-25e?pc=%7B4064C2CD-AB47-4DB0-AB9A-A91579FD303A%7D) DDR2 SDRAM

  That's right: there are 2 SDRAM chips on this board! Each one has 512Mbit in x16 configuration, good for 128MByte per DRAM and 256MByte total.

  Theoretical peak BW is 3.2GByte/s, which is pretty decent.

* 2x [Chrontel CH7301C-TF](http://www.chrontel.com/product/detail/38#) DVI Transmitter

* [SMSC USB2514HZH USB 4-Port Hub Controller](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/USB2514)

* Marvell 88E1119R-NNW2 

    https://www.mikrocontroller.net/attachment/139158/88E1111_DS.pdf is the closest. Both 1111 and 1119R have a regular GMII interface, it should be possible to get this working without.

    https://github.com/tardfs/frontend/blob/master/ethertest/xapp1042/marvell_88e1111.c supports the same family of GigE PHYs.
    
    https://github.com/Undrizzle/apps/blob/master/DSDT_3.0/phy/ supports 88E1119R directly and highlights the differences with 88E1111.
    
    Joel Williams' [Atlys Resources] https://joelw.id.au/FPGA/DigilentAtlysResources implemented receiving UDP packets with 88E1111 and Spartan 6, ISE project and Xilinx app note XAPP1042 linked from his page. Open sourced. 

* [Micron M25P128 Serial Flash with SPI](https://www.micron.com/~/media/documents/products/data-sheet/nor-flash/serial-nor/m25p/m25p_128.pdf)

    128Mbit or 32MByte. 54MHz.

    Marked as 25P28V6G. Which translates to M25P128 with [this code translator](https://www.micron.com/~/media/Documents/Products/Technical%20Note/NOR%20Flash/tn1224_spi_marking.pdf).
